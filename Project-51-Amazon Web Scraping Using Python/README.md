**1) This is a simple project for scrap necesarray data from e-shopping website like AMAZON.
2) In this project I use Jupyter Nootbook and use the language python.
3) So if anyone want to access the project, you don't just copy and paste the code in any python environment editor, the code surely not work.
4) To just copy the code and run in any .py env, you have to change your UI setting for that editor. SO -----------------
 for PYCHARM editor ------> To enable the jupyter nootbook UI, open project settings/preferences (Ctrl+Alt+S), go to Languages & Frameworks | Jupyter, and select the Show cell toolbar checkbox.

for VSCODE editor --------> at first copy the code and save in vs code with .ipynb format. Then if you download the extension of jupyter then  the code surely work.
