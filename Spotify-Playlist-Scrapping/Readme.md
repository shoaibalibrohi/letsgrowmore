# Spotify Playlist of Songs Scrapper with lyrics


Spotify keeps a lot of data on its songs internally, that we can access through the Spotify API. 
The Spotify API is a great public tool, allowing the use of Spotify’s wealth of data on music to build many kinds of systems.
The Spotify API is quite powerful, and gives us access to a lot of information about any song or artist on Spotify.
This ranges from features describing the “feel” of the audio, such as the variables “liveness”, “acousticness”, and “energy”, through to the features describing the popularity of the artist and song.
