# Indian National Flag

Turtle is a pre-installed Python library. 
It enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. T
he onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called as turtle.

The turtle has three attributes: a location, an orientation (or direction), and a pen.
Here, we will be using many turtle functions like begin_fill(), end_fill() to fill color inside the Flag, penup(), pendown(), goto() etc to reaching the target.
