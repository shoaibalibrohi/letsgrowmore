# Word Guessing Game

The game involves an array of words from which our interpreter will select one random word. 
The player must first input their names and is challenged to guess the alphabet of their choice after that. 
If the random word is comprised of the alphabet, it will be displayed in the output (with proper placement); 
otherwise, the program will prompt you to choose an alternative alphabet. Users will be given 12 turns (can be modified according to) to determine the full word.
